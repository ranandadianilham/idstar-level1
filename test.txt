1. 'this' refer to an object. there is variety of use for 'this' depend on context.
in Bind(), call(), apply(), 'this' let the function access object value set into the function.
Bind(): to bind a value into a function. return the copy of the function. 
call(): set 'this' inside a function then immediately call the function. only return value. accept comma separated value as parameter.
apply(): similar to call(), set 'this' inside function then immediately call the function. but accept array as parameter.

2. memoization is an action to avoid repetitive function calling that process same value each time there is re-render by caching processed value.
memoization help to improve to reduce calculation process normally needed each time function called, especially good process that require expensive calculation.

3. asyncronous: to execute a process parallel with another process without needing to wait for each other to finish first.
sycnronous: executing process once at a time. If there is already running process, another process need to wait until running process is finished.

4.a function with capability to pause and resume it's execution allowing generator function suit for iteration of value

5. async/await : a function using async will return a promise, and using 'await' within an async function will halt the function execution until promise is resolved.
promise: a placeholder that represent a value that is still on operation and eventually return a value, whether is is failed or success.
